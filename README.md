# Crime Record Management
This is a project to demonstrate the use of java in crime record management system for police or any other agency. This project consists the use of JAVA, JAVA SWING and a MySQL database. It is a good example to understand the use of SQL in JAVA programs and to link them to an interface using SWING.

Here, the **CrimeRecordManagement.java** file supports the backend and is mainly responsible for the logic of the project, whereas, the **abc.java** file consists of the main method to execute the SWING classes and start an interface. Each class within the project have its own task and working and once the task is completed the flow is directed towards the next task.These tasks include login, add record, delete record, etc, depending upon the type of user selected, whether it be admin, record manager or constable.

When we run the **CrimeRecordManagement.java** file the program will compile and execute in runtime and hence the output will come in the terminal screen, to get the working in the interface the **abc.java** file is used.

This project is specifically made for this single database and all the tables used in the program exist within the database.
